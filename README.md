# Bappy Flirb

A simple arcade game, created from my [Unity 2D Jam Template](https://github.com/peabnuts123/Unity-2D-Jam-Template). It is the first game written for my other project [Pet Game](https://github.com/peabnuts123/pet-game). It will be used to make a proof of concept for hosting games on the website. Players will be able to submit their scores for points, and to record scores on a leaderboard.

For now this project is very simple and empty. In the coming weeks it will be developed into more of a real game.
